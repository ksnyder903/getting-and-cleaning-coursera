Assignment for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data Course


There are three files in this repo. 

# 1. run_analysis.R

This script contains the actual R code that was used to complete the assignment. The assignment is based on a dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that contains data of 30 subjects performing normal daily activities while wearing a smartphone with embedded sensors. 

Information on the dataset is available here. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The following steps were taken to complete the assignment. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# 2. CodeBook.md

This file explains the variables available in the dataset as is from the UCI website, as well as the transformations that were undertaken to achieve the final, summarized tidy data set. 

# 3. README.md

This file explains the other files in the repo and the general idea of the project.
